# F1 Data Visualization Project
This project uses Python and Streamlit to create interactive visualizations of Formula 1 (F1) race data, specifically focusing on drivers' lap times.  The application allows users to explore and analyze this data in a user-friendly and engaging way.

## Features
* Interactive Visualizations: Explore various charts and graphs displaying drivers' lap times, enabling insightful comparisons and analysis.
* User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, the application provides a clean and intuitive interface, requiring minimal technical expertise to use.
* Data Filtering and Customization: Users can filter data to focus on specific drivers, races, or time periods, allowing for tailored analysis. (Note: The level of customization may depend on the data included.)
## Data Source: (Specify the data source used here. e.g., "Data is sourced from [link to data source, if applicable], providing up-to-date information.")
